# fall_detection_through_acceleration_data

In the C++ folder the fall detection algorithm is implemented in the C++ programming language, while in the python folder is implemented in the python programming language.

More details about the algorithm and its usage can be found in the README files, which are included in the folders, as well as in the comment sections.
